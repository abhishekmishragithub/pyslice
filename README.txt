Welcome to Pyslice - dataset template engine's documentation!
=============================================================
Pyslice is a specialized templating system that replaces variables in a template data set with numbers taken from all combinations of a grouped series of numbers. It creates a dataset from input template files for each combination of variables in the series. 

The main function of Pyslice is to provide utility functions for parametric modeling. Parametric modeling is a process of varying many inputs to a model. A drawback to parametric modeling is that there are usually hundreds to thousands of data sets to prepare and a corresponding number of model runs. Pyslice will create the model data sets and manage the model runs, or place the model runs in a queue managed by other software. Pyslice is also useful in establishing the sensitivity of a model to changing parameters.
